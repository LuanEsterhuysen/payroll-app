4. Run `ng serve` for a development server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Time Spent

Time was allocated as follows in the development of the project:

- Initial Setup and Node.js Update: 15 mins
- Mock Data and Services: 20 mins
- UI Layout: 10 mins
- Data Table Functionality (including sorting and searching): 2 hours
- Error Handling and Debugging: 4 hours that was not counted as I went in my personal capacity since the problem intrigued me

- Final Adjustments and Documentation: 15 mins

## Challenges

During the development of PayrollApp, several challenges were faced:

- Data Fetching Error: Initially encountered a 404 error due to an incorrect file path in fetching mock data. This was resolved by correcting the path in the service.
- Angular Material Compatibility: Faced issues with MatIconModule, which required multiple updates and installations to resolve compatibility issues.

## Improvements

Given more time, the following improvements could be implemented:

- Pagination in Data Tables: To improve user interaction with data tables.
- Constants and Style Management: Centralize constants and styles to streamline development and maintenance.
- Complete Feature in its entirety: Complete all work given.
- Expand Testing: Increase coverage and variety in testing to ensure broader validation of functionality.
